# Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

A machine learning project completed during a **SmartBridge Virtual Internship**, focused on predicting life expectancy using socio-economic and health indicators from WHO datasets.

The project applies regression models, data preprocessing, and exploratory analysis to predict life expectancy across countries with high accuracy.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Life expectancy varies significantly across countries due to factors such as healthcare spending, education, GDP, disease prevalence, and lifestyle indicators.

This project aims to predict **average life expectancy** using machine learning models trained on historical WHO data.
